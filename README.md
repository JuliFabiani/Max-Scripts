# JuliFabiani / MAXScripts for 3ds Max 2024

*Hi! I took the time to make a place where I could upload different scripts that I have made over time. All scripts were tailor-made for my particular workflow, some functions may be useful, while others may seem extremely specific. If any script seems interesting to you, feel free to use it free of charge.*

There are two possible locations to place the scripts: 

**C:\Users\\[Your username]\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\2024 - 64bit\ENU\usermacros\\**
- Here will go "MACRO scripts" (also called usermacros), these are blocks of instructions to perform a specific function, generally associated with a button, action, etc.
- Files with a ".mcr" extension will go here

**C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2024\stdplugs\stdscripts\\**
- Scripts that have more than just a "macro" will go here, such as general variables, timers, declaration of general functions and so on.
- Files with a ".ms" extension will go here

> **DISCLAIMER:** *Some scripts are modifications (or not even) of scripts from other authors. All credits to those people who own those scripts. If you consider that any script should be removed from the repertory, please contact me.*
